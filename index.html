            The USDA defines food insecurity as 
            "the limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain 
            ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways."
            </p>

          <p class = "text" style = "padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">
            In 2018 alone, more than 14.3 million U.S households suffered from food insecurity
            (<a style = "color: #2F9630" href = "https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/research/map-the-meal-gap/2016/2016-map-the-meal-gap-all-modules.pdf">Feeding America</a>).
            With limited resources and a limited food budget to spend, a 2014 study found that 79% of food insecure households resorted to inexpensive, unhealthy food, as they sacrificed diet quality
            over quantity. An additional 31% of study participants also mentioned "[having] to choose between food and education"
            (<a style = "color: #2F9630" href = "https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/impact-of-hunger">Feeding America</a>).
            <br><br>
            Not only does the lack of a stable and nutritious food source contribute to an overall poorer health, but it has also proven
            to have adverse effects on the development of young children, including "increased hospitalizations, [...] iron deficiency,
            developmental risk and behavior problems, primarily aggression, anxiety, depression, and attention deficit disorder" 
            (<a style = "color: #2F9630" href = "https://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/indicator/2012/06/household-food-insecurities#:~:text=Household%20food%20insecurity%20has%20insidious,Frank%2C%202008%3B%20Whitaker%2C%20Phillips">American Psychological Association</a>).
            <br><br>
            But what if families didn't have to choose between food and education? What if they could <i>grow</i> their own fresh produce from the comfort of their homes, while their
            children could simulatanously learn about hydroponics?
            <br><br>
            Food shouldn't have to be a luxury and we're here to fix that.

              we are Nom Nom: a social-impact-based venture targeting food insecurity in urban areas. Nom Nom delivers 24/7 accessibility and a centralized location of non-perishable goods to low-income and food insecure people who lack a stable and consistent food supply thatâ€™s easy to access and reliably find. 

unlike food banks, community gardens, and communal fridges/pantries that require extensive volunteers and time in order to manage, Nom Nom offers the accessibility and efficiency of a self-managed community service.

fundamental to our mission is the belief that anyone, regardless of race, gender, age, or socioeconomic status, deserves the right to have a stable and nutritious food source. 

your input is greatly appreciated.
